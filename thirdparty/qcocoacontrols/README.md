The library helps to make use of native macOS controls in a Qt app. On Windows (and others?) it should provide a decent fallback.

Tested with Qt 5 (5.6.3 and Qt 5.13.2).

Many of those controls are used in our [Macs Fan Control](https://crystalidea.com/macs-fan-control) and [AnyToISO](https://crystalidea.com/anytoiso) apps.

The code is far from being ideal so you're welcome to contribute.

To compile on macOS we use Qt Creator and Visual Studio 2017 Community on Windows
